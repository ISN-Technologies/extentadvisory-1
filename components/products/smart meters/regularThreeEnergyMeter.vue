              <p>
                Maintaining the distribution network and detecting water leakages are ongoing challenges for any water utility. Traditionally, locating leaks has been time-consuming and renovating pipes based on their age alone was always less than optimal.
                <br>The newest generation of smart metering solutions changes all this. Real knowledge based on intelligent meter data keeps you up to speed on flow, temperature, bursts and more, allowing for accurate billing, faster leakage detection and efficient renovation of your distribution network.
                <br>You can work more efficiently, proactively maintain pipes and reduce unpaid water â€“ all while ensuring a high security of supply.
                And it doesn't stop there. Take customer service to the next level by offering much more than just accurate billing. Our solutions allow you to provide the readily available information that today's customers have come to expect.
                <br>It's time to unleash the potential of knowledge in smart water metering. It's time to know!</p>
